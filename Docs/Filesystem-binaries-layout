# 🧊 BlackIce System Binaries and Filesystem Layout

## 📌 Purpose

This note documents the best practices for installing and managing BlackIce binaries, config files, logs, and modules on systems where BlackIce is *deployed*. It includes rationale for system-wide placement, structure, and operability in line with Unix and Arch conventions.

## 📂 Why Not Use Subdirectories Inside `/usr/local/bin`

why not create something like:

```
/usr/local/bin/BlackIce/
```

This is discouraged because:

* 🔧 `/usr/local/bin/` is expected to contain **executable files**, not subdirectories.
* 🧭 Most shells and system tools will **not search nested paths** under `$PATH`.
* 📉 It breaks expectations of maintainers and users who rely on `which`, `command -v`, or autocompletion.
* ❌ Running `blackice-daily-summary` would not work unless manually sourced or PATH-modified.

**Therefore:**
Place BlackIce executables **directly inside** `/usr/local/bin/`, not a subfolder.

## ✅ Proper System Binary Locations

| Path                | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/usr/bin`          | Package-managed system binaries                  |
| `/usr/local/bin`    | Admin-installed or custom local scripts/binaries |
| `/opt/`             | Full third-party applications                    |
| `/usr/local/share/` | Shared data, templates, and resources            |
| `/var/log/`         | Logs generated by tools and scripts              |
| `/etc/`             | System-wide configuration                        |

## 🧠 BlackIce Deployment Layout (Targeted)

This layout assumes BlackIce is being installed to a production machine:

```
/usr/local/bin/
├── blackice-daily-summary
├── blackice-launchpad
├── blackice-setup

/etc/blackice/
├── blackice.conf
├── rules.d/

/var/log/blackice/
├── summary-latest.log
├── summary-2025-06-19.log

/opt/blackice/    (optional)
├── full framework clone (read-only runtime)
```

---

## 🔗 On Symlinking Executables

If you decide to store the *actual scripts* in a deeper location (e.g., `/opt/blackice/bin/`), you can expose them to the system like this:

```bash
ln -s /opt/blackice/bin/blackice-daily-summary /usr/local/bin/blackice-daily-summary
```

This provides the best of both worlds:

* 🚀 Executables are available in `$PATH`
* 🗃️ Source remains organized and updatable under `/opt/blackice`

Use `readlink` to verify:

```bash
readlink -f /usr/local/bin/blackice-daily-summary
```

---

## 🗃️ Notes on Structure and Support Locations

* `/usr/local/share/blackice/`: Holds reusable assets like message templates, display files, help docs, or per-module data.
* `/opt/blackice/`: If BlackIce is ever distributed as a full framework (git clone, compressed bundle, etc.), this is its canonical root.
* `/var/log/blackice/`: Scripts like the daily summary should write logs here. This keeps logs separate from user home directories, adheres to the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard), and allows log rotation.

---

## ✅ Summary

* **No nested bin dirs**: Keep executables in `/usr/local/bin/`, not in `/usr/local/bin/BlackIce/`.
* **Use symlinks** if binaries live deeper (like `/opt/blackice/bin/`).
* **Leverage** standard system locations for long-term maintainability, automation, and packaging.
* **Design BlackIce as a clean, modular, UNIX-aligned framework.**
